* Introduction

  The purpose of the Incrementalist library is incremental parsing of
  Common Lisp code that is contained in a [[https://github.com/robert-strandh/cluffer][Cluffer]] buffer into a syntax
  tree. The parsing is incremental in the sense that after a small
  change in the buffer text, the syntax tree can be update with a
  small amount of parsing work.

  *This library is under active development. Its ASDF system
  structure, package structure, exported symbols and protocols may
  change at any time. Consult the NEWS file or the "Changelog" section
  of the manual for lists of changes in specific versions.*

  This document only gives a very brief overview and highlights some
  features. Proper documentation can be found in the
  file:documentation directory.
