;;; MAPWAD calls a function for each wad in a list of wads given as
;;; argument.  A wad in the list can be relative or absolute.  If a
;;; wad is absolute, then the START-LINE of that wad is absolute.  If
;;; a wad is relative, then the START-LINE of that wad is relative to
;;; some reference.  If the first wad of the list of wads that was
;;; passed as an argument is a relative wad, then the START-LINE of
;;; that wad is relative to REFERENCE-LINE-NUMBER.  Otherwise, it is
;;; relative to the absolute start line of the previous wad in the
;;; list.

;;; FUNCTION is a function of two arguments, the wad and the absolute
;;; start line of that wad.
